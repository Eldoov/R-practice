She was formerly titled CS 555 Data Analysis and Visualization with R. 
This course provides an overview of the statistical tools most commonly used to process,  analyze,  and visualize data. Topics include simple linear regression,   multiple regression, logistic regression,  analysis of variance,  and survival analysis. These topics are explored using the statistical package R, focusing on understanding how to use and interpret output from this software and how to visualize results. The methodology,   including underlying assumptions, its mechanics, and the appropriate interpretation of the results, are discussed in each topic area.  Concepts are presented in the context of real-world examples.

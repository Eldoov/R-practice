- What is this dataset about? (Boston crime rate)
  - What sorts of crimes are the most often ones in each year? （直方图+饼图）
  - Where did the crime happen most often in each year? （直方图+饼图）
  - Does the crime rate increase or decrease every year? Or there's no obvious change?
  - In one week, which day does the crime happen the most? How about which hour?
    - Does weekday have more crimes or the opposite?
    - Answer the above questions in the top three cities where crime happens most often.
  - How many crime incidents involve guns? 
  - In all the violent crimes, what weapons do people use?
  - How many people get killed each year?
- Hypothesis? Does crime happen in poor districts more often? Any connection between columns?
- Prediction. Use different algorithms to predict when and where the crime will happen.
